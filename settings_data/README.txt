This is the Settings Directory.
Files stored here are to keep the permanant Settings configurations.
Files stored here will be instanced into the batch variables, and used thereafter.

For Contributers, if you Commit new types of settings, their permanant data can be stored here.

Remember there will be a new Directory for each setting to avoid conflicts.
