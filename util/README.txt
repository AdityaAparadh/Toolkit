This is the Utilities Directory.
Files stored here are to keep the various utilities provided in the program.
Files stored here will be instanced into the batch variables, and used thereafter.


For Contributers, if you want to commit new utilities, they mush be packaged in a independent batch file

Remember there will be a new Directory for each utility to avoid conflicts.
So commit a new Directory with your Utility batch file.
