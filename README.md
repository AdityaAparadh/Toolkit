This project aim to create a handy set of daily-used tools, all packaged in an ultralight Batch file.

A set of batch files, packaged as an executable, will serve as some of the regular tasks daily users will require. Adding a feature is easy! Just commit a new batch file.

Will Update this once the project is initialized.
